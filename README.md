In addition to the code provided by Microsoft, this repository will be set up with bootable images for use with 86Box and Virtualbox. Organization/layout for future 'releases' <b>(if any)</b> is still being decided. At the moment everything will go into v4-builds. For now, my first priority is to get something bootable out the door and into people's hands for them to play with as well. 

The source herein contains fixes by [Neozeed](https://github/neozeed/dos400) and cleanup by [Starfrost](https://starfrost.net)
